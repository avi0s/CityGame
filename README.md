# CityGame
A City guessing game made in Java swing, inspired by daily geography games. 
Starts with obscure clues about a city, and gets progresively easier to win.

Used GoogleMaps Static APIs for satellite imagery and streetview, OpenWeather for the live weather details, and Time.io for timezone info.

2nd Semester final project.
